# Liikennematto

Liikennematto (Finnish for a "traffic mat/rug") is a prototype of a village builder game of a tiny scale. The inspiration comes from traffic rugs/road carpets that children play with. The prototype currently works like a board game where cars take turns in roaming around the "game board".

This is what I have so far:

- simple collision detection
- a two-lane road network on a grid
- signal intersections (traffic lights)
- yield sign based intersections
- stop sign based intersections
- dead end streets
- basic textures
- basic UI with debug info and simulation controls
