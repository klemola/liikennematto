## Build the roads and the town comes to life

In Liikennematto (Finnish for "traffic mat") the gameplay is simple: you only build the roads. After a short while, lots appear. With the lots come buildings and their residents. The residents drive around the road network you've created and visit other lots.

### Playful design

Liikennematto is inspired by children's traffic mats. The design of the game follows the traffic mat basics: mixed perspective buildings, plenty of color, clear dark outlines.

Liikennematto is meant for players of all ages and abilities. The UI is free of text and everything's quite large and easy to comprehend.

### Detailed simulation

Cars move and turn smoothly, avoid collision with each other, follow traffic signals and park on lots. Drivers plan their routes ahead and follow them the best they can - rerouting when necessary.
